        - Build issues
          - Ideas on what's wrong are welcome (e.g. Patch XYZ is failing on the hunk PYZ, building fails after commit 0705322...).
        - Boot issues
          - Please attach pictures of any message that shows on-screen during the failed boot
        - Runtime issues
          - Please look through `sudo dmesg` to see if any issue is logged

        Notes:
        - If copy-pasting code or from the console, please put ``` in a standalone line before and after
        - Feel free free to drag & drop any relevant text file (needs `.txt` extension)

      label: Relevant logs
      description: |
        Please drag & drop all the files inside the `logs` folder, right after the build issue happened (or for the kernel you've built that have issues).
        Add anything else you deem useful in understanding what's wrong.

        Notes:
        - If you are using the kernel from the [releases](https://github.com/Frogging-Family/linux-tkg/releases) page, please mention it.
        - Arch users: the full build output isn't captured automatically, please re-run `makepkg [args] | tee shell-output.log.txt` then drag & drop that file
